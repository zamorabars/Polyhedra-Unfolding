\section*{Introduction}


A \textit{net of a polyhedron} is an arrangement of edge-joined polygons in the plane which can be folded along its edges to become the faces of the polyhedron. The first known record of this procedure is the renaissance book \textit{The Painter's Manual} by Albert Durer \cite{Du}. In this book, Durer shows how to cut and develop some figures, including all five regular polyhedra.  


%% Once we cut a convex polyhedron $P$ along a spanning tree $T$ of its 1-skeleton, we obtain a compact surface $P_T$, which is homeomorphic to a closed disc. Since $P_T$ does not have any cycles, once we map isometrically one face into $\R^2$, there is a unique way of mapping (unfolding) its complement face by face in such a way that when two faces share an edge not in $T$, then their images share the corresponding edge, and consecutive faces do not overlap. We are going to denote this map as $f_T$. This map restricted to the interior of $P_T$ is an isometric immersion into the plane. However, $f_T$ does not have to be injective (see figure \ref{Tet}). If it is, then we say it is a \textit{net} of $P$.

In 1975 Geoffrey Shephard \cite{Sh} posed the problem to determine whether all convex polyhedra have a net. Let us discuss this problem in more detail. 



To obtain a net one has to cut a convex polyhedron $P$ along a spanning tree $T$ of its 1-skeleton. This way we obtain a flat surface $P_T$, which is homeomorphic to a closed disc. The surface $P_T$ can be mapped isometrically face by face into the plane in an essentially unique way; denote this map by $f_T\colon P_T\to \mathbb{R}^2$. 


If $f_T$ is injective then the image $f_T(P_T)$ is a net of $P$. However $f_T$ might not be injective as figure \ref{Tet} shows. Therefore Shephard's problem is asking if for any convex polyhedron $P$ there is a spanning tree $T$ such that $f_T$ is injective.

%  G.C. Shephard \cite{Sh} posed in 1975 the problem to determine whether all convex polyhedra have a net. Experimental results do not give us enough information to expect a positive or negative answer to the problem. However, Mohammad Ghomi solved a similar problem, which is to develop any polyhedron after a suitable stretching in one direction (theorem \ref{Str} below). In particular, every polyhedron is affinely equivalent to one with a net, and having a net does not depend on the combinatorial structure of the polyhedron. 


Recently Mohammad Ghomi \cite{Gh} proved the existence of a net for any polyhedron after a suitable stretching in one direction (theorem \ref{Str} below). In particular, every polyhedron is affinely equivalent to one with a net, and having a net does not depend on the combinatorial structure of the polyhedron. 


\begin{teorema}\label{Str}
{\rm Let $P$ be a convex polyhedron, then there is a linear stretching $L$, such that $L(P)$ has a net.}
\end{teorema}


Let $\xi $ be a direction not orthogonal to any line determined by two vertices of $P$. Applying a rotation sending $\xi $ to $e_1 $, we obtain a polyhedron such that no edge is orthogonal to $e_1$. Therefore, after a suitable stretching in the direction of the $x$ axis, all the edges of the obtained polyhedron $Q$  form a sufficiently small angle with $e_1$ (less than $\frac{\pi}{20 N}$ will do, where $N$ is the number of edges of $P$).


We now define an ordering on the set of vertices of $Q$. We say that $v \leq v^{\prime}$ if the first coordinate of $v$ is less or equal than the first coordinate of $v^{\prime}$. We will denote by $y$ and $z$ the minimal and maximal vertices respectively.

We define an \textit{ascending sequence} as a set of vertices $\{ p_0, p_1, \ldots , p_n   \}$ such that $p_i \leq p_{i+1}$ and $p_i p_{i+1}$ are connected by an edge for all $i \in \{ 0,1, \ldots, n-1 \} $. We say that a spanning tree $T$ with root $z$ is \textit{increasing} if for any vertex $v\in Q$ there is a (unique) ascending sequence from $v$ to $z$ contained in $T$. 

Note that all terminal edges of an increasing tree form an angle close to $\pi$ with $e_1$. Otherwise, the path in $T$ joining the corresponding leaf to $z$ wouldn't be an ascending sequence (see figure \ref{Mon}). Also, all the ends of the surface $Q \backslash T$ point in the direction of the $x$ axis.

\caption{Terminal edges of an increasing tree $T$ point leftwards and ends of $Q \backslash T$ point rightwards.}\label{Mon}
\end{figure}

%In what follows, we give a proof of theorem \ref{Gho} below, which clearly implies theorem \ref{Str}. 



\begin{teorema}\label{Gho}
{\rm \textbf{(Ghomi)} If $Q$ is cut along any increasing tree $T$, then the unfolding map $f_T$ is injective.}
\end{teorema}



In this note we give a short and elementary proof this theorem, which clearly implies theorem \ref{Str}. 


\section*{Preliminaries}




Let $a, b, c$ be vertices such that $ab $ and $ac$ are connected by edges. We will denote by $\measuredangle bac $ the intrinsic angle at $a $ from $ab$ to $ac$ measured counterclockwise. Note that by convexity

\begin{equation}\label{Alex}
\measuredangle bac + \measuredangle  cab  < 2\pi.
\end{equation} 

For distinct $x,y,z \in \R^2$, $arg (x)$ will denote the argument from $-\pi$ to $\pi$ of $x$ as a complex number, and $\angle yxz $ will denote the angle at $x$ measured counterclockwise. We will say that two sequences of points in $\R ^2$ \textit{cross} if the broken line's determined by them do so. 
 

\begin{lema} \label{Arm}
{\rm \textbf{(Arm Lemma)} Suppose $\{ u_0, u_1, \ldots , u_m     \}, \{ v_0, v_1, \ldots , v_m      \} \subset \R^2$ satisfy
\begin{itemize}
\item $u_0 = v_0$.
\item $\vert u_j - u_{j-1} \vert = \vert v_j - v_{j-1}  \vert$ for $j=1,2, \ldots, m$.
\item $u_{j }- u_{j-1} $ and $v_j - v_{j-1} $ are almost horizontal for $j = 1, 2, \ldots , m$ (their argument is in $\left( -\frac{\pi}{10},\frac{\pi}{10} \right)$ ).
\item $arg (v_{i} - v_{i-1} )\geq arg (u_{i} - u_{i-1})$ for $i \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots, m \} $.
\end{itemize}

Then $\{ u_0, u_1, \ldots , u_m     \}$ and $ \{ v_0, v_1, \ldots , v_m      \}$ do not cross and $v_m - u_m$ is almost vertical (its argument lies in the interval $\left(  \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{10} , \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{10}  \right)$ ) 
}
\end{lema}



\begin{rem}
{\rm One can observe from figure \ref{Tet} that this lemma does not hold if  we remove the condition of $u_{j }- u_{j-1}$ and $ v_j - v_{j-1} $ being almost horizontal. The stretching is applied to meet this condition. 
}
\end{rem}




\textbf{Proof of the lemma: }We will prove this lemma by induction on $m$. The case $m=1$ is elementary plane geometry.


Suppose it holds for $m=\nu$ and take $m = \nu +1$. Construct another sequence $\{ w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_m   \}$ such that $w_1 = v_1$ and $u_{j+1}u_jw_jw_{j+1} $ is a parallelogram for $j \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , m-1\} $. Applying the induction hypothesis to $\{ w_1, w_2, \ldots w_m   \}$ and $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_m  \}$, we see that they do not cross and $arg( w_{m} - v_m) \in \left(  \frac{4 \pi}{10} , \frac{6\pi}{10}  \right)$. Also, $arg(u_m - w_m )= arg (u_1 - w_1) = arg (u_1 - v_1) \in \left(  \frac{4 \pi}{10} , \frac{6\pi}{10}  \right)$, which implies $arg(u_m - v_m)\in \left(  \frac{4 \pi}{10} , \frac{6\pi}{10}  \right)$.

% I am unsure how to do a bridge between arm lemma and the following lemma

\begin{lema}\label{Argument}
{\rm Let $S$ be a flat surface homeomorphic to a closed disc. Consider a map $f: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ such that restricted to the interior of $S$ is an isometric immersion. Then $f$ is injective if and only if $f(\partial S)$ is a simple closed curve. 
}
\end{lema}


\textbf{Proof: }One implication is trivial. The other one follows from the fact that for conformal maps $f: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, the number of preimages $f^{-1}(x)$ equals the winding number $I(f(\partial S), x )$ for all $x \in \R^2  \backslash f(\partial S)$, which is a standard fact in complex analysis (\cite{Ma}, p. 384). If $f(\partial S)$ is a simple closed curve, by Jordan Curve Theorem \cite{Ha} the winding number $I(f(\partial S), x )$ equals 0 or 1, then the function is injective.


\hfill $\Box$

\section*{Proof of Theorem \ref{Gho}}

First, construct an unfolding $f_T$ of $Q_T$ in which the images of all the edges are almost horizontal (they form an angle less than $\frac{\pi}{10}$ with $e_1 \in \R ^2$). Next, we are going to prove that $f_T(\partial Q_T)$ does not self intersect.

Consider $y^{\prime} = f_T(y) \in \R ^2$. Then, starting at $y^{\prime}$, the counterclockwise image of $\partial Q_T$ is a sequence of piecewise linear curves (broken lines) going almost horizontally rightwards and leftwards, alternately. We are going to denote the first broken line going right as $R_1$, the first one going left as $L_1$, and so on. Since $T$ is ascending, when we switch from going rightwards to leftwards, we rotate counterclockwise and when we switch from going leftwards to rightwards, we rotate clockwise (see figure \ref{Cro}). 



\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\psfrag{A}{$1$}
\psfrag{B}{$2$}
\psfrag{C}{$3$}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Bry.eps}
\caption{The image of the boundary is a sequence of broken lines going rightwards and leftwards alternately.}\label{Cro}
\end{figure}




\begin{prop}\label{Zig}
{\rm As defined above, if the sequence of broken lines $R_1L_1R_2\ldots$ 
$ L_n$ doesn't self intersect, then $R_1L_1 R_2 \ldots L_nR_{n+1}$ doesn't self intersect either.  

}
\end{prop}




\textbf{Proof: }The proof goes by induction on the number $n$ of times it has gone leftwards (in figure \ref{Cro}, $n=3$). For the case $n=1$, observe that the condition $arg (v_{i} - v_{i-1} )\geq arg (u_{i} - u_{i-1})$ for $i =1, 2, \ldots, m$ in the arm lemma is implied by $arg (v_1 - v_0 )\geq arg (u_1 - u_0)$ and $\angle v_{i+1}v_iv_{i-1}+ \angle u_{i-1}u_iu_{i+1} \leq 2\pi$ for $i\in \{ 1,2, \ldots, m-1\}$. Therefore the arm lemma completes the base of induction.

Suppose the assertion is true for $n \leq k$ and consider the case $n=k+1$.  Note that the edges of $\partial Q_T$ are paired in such a way that we glue paired edges together to obtain $Q$ from $Q_T$. Each one will be called the \textit{dual} of the other.

Observe that when we start $R_2$, we are traveling the dual edges of the leftmost part of $L_1$. If the length of $R_2$ is greater than or equal to the length of $L_1$, we can apply the induction hypothesis to $R_2L_2R_3 \ldots L_nR_{n+1}$ and the result will follow. 

If the length of $R_2$ is less than the length of $L_1$, we extend $R_2 $ with a broken line $S$ parallel to $L_1$ minus the dual of $R_2$. By the arm lemma, $S$ will be above $L_1$ (see figure \ref{S}), and by the induction hypothesis $S$ does not touch $L_2R_3 \ldots L_nR_{n+1}$ so this finishes the proof of proposition \ref{Zig}.

\hfill $\Box$



\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{S.eps}
\caption{On the left $R_2$ and $L_1$ have the same length, on the right we construct $S$ in blue.} \label{S}
\end{figure}




Now, the image of $\partial  Q_T$ will self intersect for the first time in a point $y^{\prime\prime}$ while going leftwards. Because $T$ is increasing, $f_T(\partial Q_T)$ contains a simple closed curve $\gamma$ starting at $y^{\prime \prime}$ consisting of a sequence of broken lines turning clockwise when changing from going leftwards to rightwards and counterclockwise in the other case.




\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\psfrag{A}{$y^{\prime}$}
\psfrag{B}{$y^{\prime\prime}$}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Prime.eps}
\caption{The image of $\partial Q_T$ first self intersects at $y^{\prime \prime}$.}
\end{figure}


Since all ends point rightwards, we can contract the curve $\gamma$ to the point  $y^{\prime \prime}$ moving leftwards all the time. Such contraction can be performed in the same way in $Q_T$. Therefore only one point of $\partial Q _T$ is sent to $y^{\prime \prime}$. This is only possible if $y^{\prime} = y^{\prime \prime}$ and $f_T$ restricted to $\partial Q_T$ is injective.


Applying lemma \ref{Argument} with $S=Q_T$ we get that $f_T$ is a net, completing the proof.
